# FMCG-Sales-Analysis

## Problem Statement
This project addresses the need for a unified view of sales and supply chain performance to guide data-driven decisions around stocking, marketing, and pricing in the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry.

## Objective
- Identify top-selling and most profitable product categories  
- Understand consumer behavior and purchasing trends  
- Analyze sales distribution across weekdays and months  
- Evaluate promotional effectiveness  
- Measure the contribution of each store location to total sales and profit

##  Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, Charts & Dashboard Visualization)

## Dashboard Summary
- **Beverages** lead in unit sales and respond best to promotions  
- **Saturday** is the highest sales day — ideal for launching campaigns or driving clearances  
- **Suburban stores** outperform urban and rural ones in profit contribution  
- **Snacks and Dairy** show profitability despite lower unit sales — a ripe area for targeted campaigns  
- **Total Sales Revenue:** $1,048,780  
- **Best-Selling Category:** Beverages (224,778 units sold)

##  Observations
- Consumers are highly responsive to promotions, especially for Beverages  
- Sales peak on weekends, with Saturdays showing the highest activity  
- Suburban outlets drive a disproportionate share of profits  
- Some high-profit categories are currently under-promoted

## Recommendations
- Boost weekend promotions for Beverages and Snacks  
- Prepare for peak sales around **Q3 (July–September)**  
- Explore expansion opportunities in suburban regions  
- Perform deeper segmentation to uncover underperforming SKUs within categories

## Conclusion
This analysis provides actionable insights into sales performance and consumer behavior within the FMCG sector. By leveraging Excel dashboards, businesses can make data-backed decisions to improve marketing, optimize inventory, and boost profitability.
